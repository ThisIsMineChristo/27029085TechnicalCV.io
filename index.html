  <h2>About</h2>

 <p>My journey started of as an aspiring electrical engineer with great visions for the future. During my first 2 years of university, I took on many challenges but none of them as satisfying and exciting as having to program something. This is where I fell in love with the world of coding, it's obsticles, challenges and simply the magic thereof. I took the leap and switched courses to pursue a profession in the world of IT and I haven't looked back since. Designing and constructing useful systems is something I'm very passionate about. Mobile development is something I really took an interest in and has consumed many nights just tinkering and exploring the vast capabilities of our modern technological world.</p>
